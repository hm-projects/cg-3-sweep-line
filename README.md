## Problem description

Count and find all intersections between a set of line segments using the sweep line algorithm.

### Program usage

Requirements:

- Rust > 1.69,
- Python > 3.10 with `requirements.txt` installed

## Algorithm & Implementation

### Requirements

The following requirements must be met with the input data set, and the implementation detects if this is not the case.

- No duplicate points
- No line segments with length 0
- No vertical line segments (same x coordinate for both points)
- No colinear / overlapping points, as intersection points must be unique

### Usage

```rust
let lines: Vec<Line> = read_file(file_path);
let queue: EventQueue = EventQueue::new(lines);
let intersections: BTreeSet<Point> = queue.sweep();
```

### Data structures

- `EventQueue` is a `BTreeSet` of `Events` with point and associated line segments
  - The events are ordered by their points
- `SweepLine` is `Vec` of `LineSegments` with `y` value
  - The vector is sorted by the `y` value of the line segments

### Sweeping Pseudo code

The following pseudo code is used to implement the sweep line algorithm.
Keep in mind, this is only pseudo code, and the actual implementation might differ.

```rust
fn sweep(mut self) -> BTreeSet<Point> {
    let mut sweep_line = SweepLine::new();

    while let Some(event) = self.pop_first() {
        // popping the next event ensures that the sweep line never goes backwards

        // update all line segments to their current y value at x
        sweep_line.update(event.point().x);

        match event {
                Event::Begin { point, line } => {
                    // Inserting also ensures the ordering of the sweep line
                    sweep_line.insert(point.y, line);

                    let neighbors = sweep_line.get_neighbors(&line);

                    if let Some(intersection_point) = line.intersection(neighbors.above) {
                        // adding the intersection event makes sure that the event is to the "right" of the sweep line, and was never seen before
                        self.add_intersection_event(intersection_point, line, line_above);
                    };
                    // the same is performed for neighbor below
                },
                Event::End { point: _, line } => {
                    let neighbors = sweep_line.get_neighbors(line);

                    if let Some(intersection_point) = line_below.intersection(line_above) {
                        self.add_intersection_event(intersection_point, line_below, line_above);
                    };

                    sweep_line.remove(line);
                },
                Event::Intersection {
                    point: intersection_point,
                    line,
                    other_line,
                } => {
                    // this swaps the two lines in the sweep line, and returns the new neighbors
                    let swapped = sweep_line.swap_and_get_new_neighbors(
                        line,
                        other_line,
                        intersection_point,
                    );

                    // test for intersections after swap
                    if let Some(intersection_point) = swapped.bigger.intersection(line_above) {
                        self.add_intersection_event(intersection_point, swapped.bigger, line_above);
                    };
                    // same is done for other pair
                },
        }
    }

    return self.intersection_points;
}
```
